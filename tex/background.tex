\textquote{In the multiclass text classification task, we are given a training
 set of documents, each labeled as belonging to one of K disjoint classes, and
  a new unlabeled test document. Using the training set as a guide, we must
  predict the most likely class for the test document.}\cite{Do:2006aa}
