Something

Further research

\begin{itemize}
  \item how well do word2vec and comparable methods generalize: e.g. initialize a text corpus with word vectors from a bigger corpus (Google News), then train an RNN to predict the next word vector using the small corpus but use the bigger corpus to validate and see if words in bigger corpus can be inferred
  \item
\end{itemize}
