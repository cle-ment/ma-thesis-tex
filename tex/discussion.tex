\section{Discussion and Conclusions}

\subsection{Contributions}
\label{sub:contributions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item compare n-gram and doc2vec (?)
  \item
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Further research}
\label{sub:further-research}

\begin{itemize}
  \item how well do word2vec and comparable methods generalize: e.g.\ initialize a text corpus with word vectors from a bigger corpus (Google News), then train an RNN to predict the next word vector using the small corpus but use the bigger corpus to validate and see if words in bigger corpus can be inferred
  \item trajectory based algorithms (word trajectory through space for a sentence)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Learnings}
\label{sub:learnings}

\begin{itemize}
  \item focusing on both, building a working system (engineering) and exploring new directions (science), is hard
  \item problem framing is hard
\end{itemize}
