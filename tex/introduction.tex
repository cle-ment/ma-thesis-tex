\section{Introduction}

Language is one of the most complex behaviors our species has developed. We humans use it to efficiently transport knowledge between individuals and communicate even the most abstract concepts with it. It takes children years to learn to learn express their thoughts and the subtle nuances of one's language give a glimpse one's cultural environment and upbringing, one's emotional state and one's intellect.

Not surprisingly in the field of \gls{AI} and especially \gls{ML} building computer systems with linguistic capabilities and solving language-based problems poses one of the hardest challenges and has motivated decades of research in Computational Linguistics. In fact many of the famous test for universal machine intelligence are based on linguistic capabilities, among them the famous \emph{Turing test} by~\cite{Turing:1950aa} where the task is for a human judge to determine whether he is having a conversation with a human or a machine in order to determine if the machine can be called intelligent, or the \emph{compression test} proposed by~\cite{Mahoney:1999aa}, where a human's and machine's capability to predict missing words given a context is tested.

This thesis explores the specific task of predicting the semantic structure of job advertisements as a specific example of such a language-based task that turns out to be difficult even for humans to do. The title of this work ``An \emph{Exploration} of \emph{Recent Connectionist Advances} for \emph{Supervised Topic Prediction in Job Advertisements}'' can be broken down into three pieces that captures the essence of it:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Exploration: The nature of this work is explorative in 2 ways: First a problem has been researched to find well-defined and well-motivated application of machine learning on job advertisement data. Second a solution space was explored approach this problem with special emphasis at recent progress in research.
  \item Recent Connectionist Advances: The work
\end{itemize}


The work was done in close collaboration with the Helsinki-based media and learning company \emph{Sanoma}\footnote{\textquote{Sanoma is a front running consumer media and learning company in Europe. In Finland and the Netherlands we are the market leading media company with a broad presence across multiple platforms. In Belgium we are among the Top 5. Our main markets in learning are Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden. We entertain, inform, educate and inspire millions of people every day. We employ some 7,500 professional employees operating in Europe.}, Source: \url{http://www.sanoma.com/en/who-we-are}, visited 06.06.2016} and the research motivation was thus constantly tied back into real world challenges in the scope of Sanoma's business needs.

\subsection{Problem Statement}

The problem addressed during with this thesis to better understand the structure of job advertisements. In particular job postings typically consist of several parts with a certain function or theme: Usually the company is introduced, the job is described with it's tasks and responsibilities, the requirements for the job are listed, then benefits and offerings by the company are named and the reader is asked to apply in a specified way he or she is interested.
Almost all of the text\footnote{Only 4\% of the sentences collected for evaluating the final experiments in this thesis were sorted into the category \emph{other} while the rest falls into either of the categories described. This is described in more detail in Section }\todo{link section} of a job description falls into these categories and the task can thus be posed as predicting a category for each sentence in a job advertisement, that corresponds with this sentence belonging to one of the job ads' parts as described above.
This is a challenging problem in itself but can further be used to extract certain functional parts of each job ad, to study a possible correlation between structural patterns and the reach and success of an ad and so forth. The problem therefore can be labelled as \emph{Text Categorization} or \emph{Text Classification} as referred to in the scientific literature.


\subsection{Motivation}

% -- need statement

Today's media and education, the basis of Sanoma's core businesses, are undergoing drastic and fundamental transformations that are currently disrupting whole industries.

Usage of digital media as a source of information has long surpassed print media. Sanoma's most well-known product, Finland's biggest daily newspaper \emph{Helsingin Sanomat}, lost 6\% of its circulation only in 2015\footnote{Source: http://www.digitalnewsreport.org/survey/2016/finland-2016/, visited 27.07.2016}, while the wide-spread use of social media challenges traditional ways we access information. Similarly in the field of education, with the rise of Massive open online course (MOOCs), traditional learning settings are challenged and the need for advanced techniques for data processing and analysis increases, e.g.\ to personalize and adapt the learning experience to each individual user and at the same time identify trends across large groups of learners to better meet the needs of education.

Sanoma provides a recruitment platform named \emph{Oikotie Työpaikat}. The service is in direct competition several other international players in the recruitment industry. Through this and other services Sanoma's collects large amounts of user-generated data, offering the potential to be leveraged for machine learning solutions to provide value for their users and innovate and enrich the company's offerings.
This was the company's initial motivation for this thesis project --- To explore ways to leverage user-generated data to potentially.

From my personal perspective this offered many interesting research possibilities while at the same time being relevant for a real business. Natural Language Processing and Computer Linguistics had always been of strong interest to me for the complex nature and yet high interpretability of problems and their proximity and relatedness to progress in universal machine intelligence. This presented me with the challenge position to balance pursuing research objectives and yet exploring potential business and user needs, learn on new fronts and deepen my knowledge in others as well as combining my experience in Product Development and Innovation, thus made for a great project to mark the competition of my studies as a Master's student.


\subsection{Related work}

The problem of \gls{TC}, formally defined in Section~\ref{subs:Context: Definition of Text Classification}, is one of the various challenges in the thriving fields of \gls{CL} and \gls{NLP}. These areas of research have started out as theoretically challenging but rather marginally interesting fields between \gls{AI} and formal linguistics and have since exploded in terms of popularity with their applications being deployed currently at large scale to practically all kinds of consumer products such as smart phones and home entertainment systems as well as digital services like social networks or automatic translation engines and conversational agents, so-called chatbots.
Today there are textbooks dedicated specifically to this area, such as~\cite{Manning:1999aa},~\cite{Jurafsky:2014aa} and~\cite{Clark:2013aa} There is also much overlap to the field of \gls{IR} that rose to popularity during the late 1980's due to the Internet starting to become a mainstream medium (see~\cite{Manning:2008aa},~\cite{Leskovec:2014aa} and the classic work by~\cite{Rijsbergen:1979aa}).

The field of Natural Language Processing has undergone different trends of modeling approaches to tackle its challenges. \cite{Cambria:2014aa} identify these as three main trend curves focusing on \emph{Syntactics}, \emph{Semantics}, and \emph{Pragmatics}. According to the authors the first trend of syntax-centered NLP is still prevalent and is based on algorithms that more or less directly operate on the words found in the processed texts.
The second trend operates on the semantics of text, thus being able to potentially tackle more challenging problems by addressing increasingly subtle notions of meaning and context. According to the author these types of approaches are still in the early phase but at the verge of being adapted by a broader audience of researchers and practitioners in the field.
The last trend curve of pragmatics regards the yet more complex issue of modeling inherent narratives in language where so far only pioneering work has been done but which, according to the authors, will lead to tackling problems of natural language understanding.
% With regards to this perspective, this thesis falls between the first and second trend curve by comparing more traditional, syntax based approaches to those modeling latent semantics.

The problem of \gls{TC} specifically has seen many evolving fashions of approaches and more or less loosely follows the three trend curves described above. \gls{TC} has been of immense interest for several decades now due to the exponentially increasing amounts of text data being recorded in forms of e.g. user generated content through social networks and through the increased digitalization of our daily lives. Its applications reach from document filtering, automated metadata generation such as language classification to automatic email labeling, spam identification and sentiment detection, amongst others.

As~\cite{Sebastiani:2002aa} points out it is important to mention that the term \emph{automatic text classification} has also been used referring to different problems: \textquote{Aside from (i) the automatic assignment of documents to a predefined set of categories [\ldots], the term has also been used to mean (ii) the automatic identification of such a set of categories (e.g.,~\cite{Borko:1963aa}), or (iii) the automatic identification of such a set of categories and the grouping of documents under them (e.g.,~\cite{Merkl:1998aa}), a task usually called text clustering, or (iv) any activity of placing text items into groups, a task that has thus both TC and text clustering as particular instances~\cite{Manning:1999aa}}~\cite{Sebastiani:2002aa}

Early approaches towards solving text classification tasks in the 1980's were in often based on expert systems consisting of sets of manually created logical rules, deciding upon the category of a text segment if a certain formula applies. As discussed by \cite{Sebastiani:2002aa} the biggest downside is known as the \emph{knowledge acquisition bottleneck} which refers to the fact that each rule has to be manually created. In the 1980's machine learning approaches became more common where a \emph{classifier} automatically learns the attributes of the data and its association with the given data labels using a model that allows to then infer the categories for unseen data. This setting is called \emph{supervised learning} as labels for the data are given and predicted.

Machine learning approaches have since been developed in countless variations. As described earlier syntax-based approaches are still very common and most follow a classic pipeline of \emph{feature extraction} or \emph{indexing} of documents followed by \emph{inductive construction} of a classifier that is lastly evaluated by a measure of effectiveness. A very successful approach to feature extraction has been the introduction of N-Gram based models, also called \emph{bag-of-words} models, which that are based on word-cooccurrence frequencies of the terms that are present in the data.
As~\cite{Mikolov:2012aa} explains \textquote{The most significant advantages of models based on n-gram statistics are speed (probabilities of n-grams are stored in precomputed tables), reliability coming from simplicity, and generality (models can be applied to any domain or language effortlessly, as long as there exists some training data). N-gram models are today still considered as state of the art not because there are no better techniques, but because those better techniques are computationally much more complex, and provide just marginal improvements, not critical for success of given application.}
Various extensions of these models exist for dimensionality reduction or feature selection as well as smoothing techniques etc. (refer to Section~\ref{subs:N-gram Models} for an in-depth introduction). The limitation of such models is that their statistics are directly based on word co-occurrences and thus exponentially increase in size as the desired context to be captured is expanded, making them infeasible to adapt to longer text sequences.

Recently approaches from the field of \emph{Representation Learning}, have found their way into and gained tremendous traction in the \gls{NLP} research community. Traditional \emph{feature engineering} techniques such as N-gram models, use prior domain or expert knowledge in order to build data representations that are effective in combination with a classifier. But as~\cite{Bengio:2013aa} point out this is a laborious and time-consuming task that only exposes the weakness from a Machine Learning point of view by not automatically learning such representations --- a challenge representation learning aims to address.
