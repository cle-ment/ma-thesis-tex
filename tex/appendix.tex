\subsection{Source Files and Code}

\subsubsection*{A Tool for Crowd-Sourced Tagging of Chunked Job Ads}
\label{sub:A Tool for Crowd-Sourced Tagging of Chunked Job Ads}

The following repository contains the source code for the tool described in Section~\ref{subs:Supervised Multi-label Paragraph Classification}: \url{https://github.com/cle-ment/ma-thesis-crowdsource-text-tagger}
It was used to collect labels for paragraphs with the help of volunteers. To use it a server running \gls{MongoDB} and \gls{Node.js} is needed. A jupyer notebook for preprocessing data is provided in case other data shall be used.

\subsubsection*{Implementation of Final Experiments}
\label{sub:Implementation of Final Experiments}

This repository contains all source code needed to run the final experiments which are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:Experiments and Results}: \url{https://github.com/cle-ment/ma-thesis-experiments}
Unfortunately there was no time to make these completely reproducible from scratch as most experiments were run on \gls{AWS} instances with all needed libraries setup. The code can be also be run locally though if the python modules are installed and the code to set up the instances is provided if a similar setup is to be achieved.

\subsubsection*{\LaTeX\ Source of This Thesis}
\label{sub:This Thesis}

The source files for this document can be found in the following repository: \url{https://github.com/cle-ment/ma-thesis-tex}. The source files were made public for others to use them as a template and as a side-effect document the process of writing quite nicely:

\subsection{Google News Dataset and Word Embeddings}
\label{sub:Google News Dataset and Word Embeddings}

For constructing the Bag-Of-Means model explained in Section~\ref{subp:Bag-of-Means}, pre-computed word embeddings were used which were created by~\cite{Mikolov:2013ab} from a dataset from Google News. The dataset contains 300-dimensional vectors for 3 million words and phrases and can be obtained on the following website: \url{https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/}

\subsection{Stopwords for N-grams}
\label{sub:Stopwords for N-grams}

This following list of English stop words is the one used in the \gls{scikit-learn} implementation for N-Grams and is taken from the \emph{Glasgow Information Retrieval Group}. The original list can be found at \url{http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/linguistic_utils/stop_words}.
