\section{Exploration}
\label{sec:Exploration}

This chapter will outline how with initial objectives and how I went all the way from an initial project start with exploration over collecting data and iterating the problem framing to learn from about the problem to designing the final task and collecting an appropriate dataset including quality control in a crowdsourced fashion. \todo{rewrite when chapter is done}



- initial exploration of topics
- topic decision for structured text prediction
- design choice for fixing chunks (making it a supervised multi-class prediction)
- explorative data collection
- learnings and design choice for 6 mutually exclusive labels + sentence as atomic unit => final problem setting
- dataset collection through crowdflower with iterations





% - brief
% - given data
% - interest?
% - approach
% - found problem: predicting audience and popularity of job ads
% - in order to do so: learn about structure of job ads
% - problem setting as supervised task,
% - get data by free collection:
%   - to predict paragraphs
%   - to learn about how humans interpret and carry out this task
% - experiments: grouping tags automatically vs manually
% - predicting with tf.idf
% - reading up on how to write good job ads
% - can be grouped into 6 categories
% - framed as new mulit-class problem and setting up data collection
% - results: distribution and statistics, most of the data can somewhat go into these categories (other is the smallest amount)
% - then trying to evaluate the best method or combination of methods



\subsection{Discovery Phase: Exploring the Problem Scope}
\label{Discovery Phase: Exploring the Problem Scope}

During the \emph{discover phase} of the project, also referred to as the \gls{ffe}, the problem space was explored from various perspectives to understand which opportunities could potentially fulfill the criteria set for the thesis: First to be an approachable yet challenging research problem in the scope of a Master's thesis, second to be of interest from a business point of iew

- early prototypes
- interviews
- problem mapping
- data exploration

\todo{Picture of software setup?}

To collect first data a tool was build, consisting of a Node.js\footnote{[\ldots] Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side Web applications. \url{https://nodejs.org/}} server using MongoDB\footnote{\textquote{MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database [\ldots].} Source: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js}, Website: \url{https://www.mongodb.com}} as a database and communicating via a JSON with a simple website front-end using the mustache template engine\footnote{\textquote{Mustache is a simple web template system.} Source: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustache_(template_system)}, Website: \url{https://mustache.github.io}}.
The tool is online\footnote{\url{http://thesis.cwestrup.de/jobad-tagger/}} and it's source code is publicly available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/cle-ment/thesis-tagger}} with it's API documentation hosted online as well\footnote{\url{http://thesis.cwestrup.de/jobad-tagger/apidoc/}}.

The data generated by using the free-form text description of each job ad and splitting it into paragraphs as can be seen in the software package as well\footnote{\url{https://github.com/cle-ment/thesis-tagger/blob/master/pre-processing.ipynb}}.

The goal of this prototype tool for data collection was on the one hand to acquire data in order to carry our first experiments as fast as possible, and on the other hand to gain a deeper understanding about the research problem itself by giving an open, unbiased task to the participants. In particular the question at hand was how humans label the content of the different parts of a job ad.

The exact task given to the participants was ``Describe what each section is about by adding one or more tags/keywords to it''. They were shown a job ad that was split into paragraphs and besides each paragraph was a text field to enter 1 or more tags.

  \caption{Screen capture of the interface of the tagging tool}
\label{fig:thesis-tagger-interface}
\end{figure}

In a first step the tool was only shown to 3 participants to get immediate feedback if the user interface had flaws and whether the task was understood.   Based on this feedback the tool was improved by providing an example for the participants and then tested with a slightly larger group of 12 persons. After correcting a few minor details in the user interface a public link was then shared via social media and other channels with as many people as possible. A few days later the tool was then also shared internally within Sanoma where it was set up as a competition to tag the most possible job ads.

In total 91 job ads were tagged, resulting in 379 tagged text sections and 358 tags.
