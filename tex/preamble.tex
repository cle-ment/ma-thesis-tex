%% This is done because the fullstop isn't the end of the sentence that
%% should be followed by a slightly longer space but is to be followed
%% by a regular space.

%% Tweaks the page numbering to meet the requirement of the thesis format:
%% Begin the pagenumbering in Arabian numerals (and leave the first page
%% of the text body empty, see \thispagestyle{empty} below).
%% Additionally, force the actual text to begin on a new page with the
%% \clearpage command.
%% \clearpage is similar to \newpage, but it also flushes the floats (figures
%% and tables).
%% There is no need to change these
